1. **Turtles have been around a lot longer – and seen a lot more – than you might think.**
... Turtles have been roaming the earth for over 200 million years. They lived alongside dinosaurs, and bared witness to their extinction 65 million years ago. They are older than mammals, lizards, crocodiles, snakes, and birds. 

2. **They could (hypothetically) give you a high five.**
Most species of turtle have five toes on each limb. A few turtle species only have four toes on each limb, and even more uncommonly, three toes on each limb. 

3. **Sea turtles have an internal GPS.**
Who needs Siri? Not sea turtles. They have an internal system that helps direct them across the ocean and back using the earth’s magnetic field. Turtles can sense variations in the magnetic field and can pinpoint specific coastlines by the unique magnetic signature it has.
